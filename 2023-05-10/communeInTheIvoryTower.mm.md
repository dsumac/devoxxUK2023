# A Commune in the Ivory Tower: A New Approach to Architecture

## Role / activities

- take time is important in architacture
- architecte helps to the next step on architecture
- architecte can't take a decision alone

## Models

### Decentralized way to make decision

- decision needed => decision being made => decision made
  - "decision being made" is the "advice zone"

- Decentralized way to make decision
- Support less experienced in deciding
- know about all decisions
- Know who was consulted & their advice
- use repo / jira etc. Track the decision
- refactor to optimise

### Lightweights ADR

- lightweights ADR for decision support (ce que l'on fait sur square)

### Conversations at an architectural advice forum

## How to fail

### bad decisions

### old guard === new guard
- context dependant, a bad decision a this time could be good in the future

### off the grid decisions

### no trust
- with all tools / processes (adr etc.) , we must confident in people and organisation to make a good decision

## questions

- do wa have need again of architecte: yes
  - not high level
- how scales the approach
  - don't break all in a big organisation

## Conclusion

- it's an **"anybody" approach to architecture**
