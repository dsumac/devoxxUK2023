# Distributed teams that actually work

## we are wired to create great things together

- metaphore with ... construction (castor qui construisent un barrage / translate)

## it's not a new subject

- async decision making
- help 

## challenges

- language
- channels
- async
- cultures
- timezones
- ...

## meetings

- meetings are very expensive
  - not boring and ... meetings
  - meetings often fail 
- on a maker's schedule: meeting ruins half a day (Paul Graham)

## decisions

- software is made of decisions
- four phases of a decision
  1. brainstorm
  2. define options
  3. build consensus
    - if there is not consensus, find a process:
        - voting
        - in some of organisation: management decision (not the best but it's a solution)
  4. decide

## key tools for async decision making

- broadcast channel
  - advertise upcoming decisions
- case management tool
  - to manage all decisions

## example to "swiss federal council"

- hybrid between sync & async decisions
  - win a lot of time to make decisions

## tools

- async threaded channel
  - using **tags** to flag the topics
- issue tracker
  - using **tags**
- chat
  - for short discussion
- **central** shared documents
  - really centralized

## behavior

- more effort for you (your contribution), less for them
  - ex with IMdb: all information, tags etc. All information about a movie on a page

- self-contained message, multi-level reading
  - information must be structurized with different levels of reading: introduction etc.

- radiate/express intent
  - book "turn the ship around" 

## multi-cultural teams

- country, sport, music etc.. are parts of culture
- multi-cultural disaster
  - costa concordia : italian was official language, orders in english
- use simple language
  - short, without complicated words etc.
- avoid misunderstandings
  - assume good intentions
  - ask for clarification
  - reformulate

## questions

- how efficiently mentor / share remotely ?
  - use video, reserve time for this activity etc.
