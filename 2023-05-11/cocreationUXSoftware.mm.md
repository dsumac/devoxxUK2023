# Co-creation with UX and software

## co-creating

- the team
- the process
- the details

## why

- example of a painting
  - abstract picture or not: the rendering will be different

- too meetings
- I responsible of making design too ?
- I can't guarantee the quality of my work whan I need to deliver 100 things in the same time

## team setup / diversity

- triangle:
  - skillset / type of project / personality: team in center
  - **complementarity**

### purpose

- people focus **more on WHY than what**

## team structures

### operations team

- have designer in the team make sense
  - not a day to day working UX / dev

### process team

- you can have designer in the team

### feature team

- customer journey is share between team
- designers are connected to the different teams

## models / cycles

- design thinking 101
- devops cycle

### design / dev / ops model

- model where the 3 parts collaborate
- for me: **product/marketers** / design / dev / ops

## tools / methods to co-create

### user journey

- follow the user journeys "transversaly"

### opportunity map

- all parts must be included in the reflexion (dev too)

### explore: event storming

- event / triggers / resources / conditions / command / aggregate etc.

### creation

- journey => opportunity => solution
- ideate - prototype - validate

### solution design: co create a blueprint for the solution

- phase
  - user action
  - front stage action
  - back stage action
  - supported process
  - Outpout: user stories / tickets etc..
